Designing software is a multi-faceted process that begins with understanding the problem or objective. My approach typically starts with gathering requirements and ideation, followed by planning, execution, testing, and iteration. Working on the 3D scene project, Iâ€™ve honed my skills in 3D modeling and understanding how light physics work within a simulated environment. I learned how different materials and textures can affect the overall aesthetic and functionality of a scene.

The design process for my project work was methodical. I began with finding an image to replicate, then within each module, I worked on different parts of the project such as shape, texture and positioning and eventually lighting emphasize the scene, and added more complex elements like the camera controls. Each step was iterative, with constant refining based on feedback and testing.

Tactics from my design approach, such as starting with low-fidelity prototypes and gradually increasing complexity, can be applied to future work to ensure a solid foundation before delving into more intricate details.

Developing programs for me is an iterative and structured endeavor. I utilized new strategies such as modular design, where I broke down the scene into reusable components and functions. This modularity made it easier to manage complexity and made the code more adaptable to changes.

Iteration was integral to my development process, with each phase of the project building upon the last. Starting with basic shapes and interactions, I gradually introduced more sophisticated elements, testing and refining at each step. This approach ensured that the final scene was both polished and robust.

Throughout the milestones leading to the project's completion, my code development approach has evolved to become more efficient and agile. Early on, I would write large blocks of code before testing, but I learned to make smaller, more frequent changes, testing each one to ensure stability and functionality.

In reaching my goals, computer science serves as a cornerstone by providing problem-solving frameworks and technical know-how. Computational graphics and visualizations, in particular, open up new avenues for creative expression and communication. They've equipped me with the skills to create engaging visual content, a valuable asset in educational and professional settings.

Educationally, these skills allow me to visualize complex data and concepts, which could be beneficial in research and teaching. Professionally, they translate into the ability to create simulations, renderings, and animations that can be used in various fields such as gaming, architecture, film, and virtual reality development.

In conclusion, this project has been instrumental in strengthening my software design and development skills, providing a solid foundation that will be invaluable as I continue my journey in computer science.
